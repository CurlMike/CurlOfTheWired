    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! My (online) alias is CurlMike and this is my first web development related project. <br>
        <br>
        This is The Wired. If you have watched "Serial Experiments Lain", you will already know what this is all about. <br>
        Based on the anime and especially on the PS1 game, this blog type of website will serve as a social network website. <br>
        <br>
        You can create diary entries, talk about what's on your mind and share your thoughts and problems, or simply tell how your day went. <br>
        For now that is all, but as I get more familiar with this tech, maybe it will get better. <br>
        <br>
        Maybe one day, you'll even upload your conscience here, and leave your mortal body behind. :) <br>
        <br>
        CurlMike
